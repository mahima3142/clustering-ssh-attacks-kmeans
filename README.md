# Clustering SSH Attacks using K-Means
Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to segregate different types of attacks during Secure Shell (SSH) sessions using network packet capture (PCAP) files. The project involved determining an optimal value of K and grouping similar network traffic based on cluster assignments. Technologies used: Java, WEKA
