# Clustering SSH Attacks using K-Means

• Analyzed SSH network traffic from PCAP files to identify potential attack patterns using unsupervised learning.
• Extracted protocol-level features such as packet length, time, and protocol type from captured SSH sessions.
• Applied K-Means clustering in WEKA to group similar traffic behaviors and differentiate normal versus anomalous SSH activity.
• Visualized cluster assignments to interpret traffic patterns and understand attack characteristics.
• Tools & Technologies: WEKA, Java, PCAP analysis
